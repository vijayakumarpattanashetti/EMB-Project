# Electronic Medical Bureau

Electronic Medical Bureau(EMB) is a blockchain based software platform for digital health/medical recording built on IBM Cloud using Hyperledger fabric(Bluemix Playground).<br> <br>

Abstract: <br>
High security electronic management in healthcare sector is still an expectation. However, there exists technologies that are used for electronic healthcare management which still lack in privacy, interoperability, tracking, unambiguous and complete record keeping. Outcome-based contracts, real-time atomic clearing and settlement are also the still expected major requirements.

Electronic Medical Bureau (EMB) is a blockchain based approach for one healthcare information exchange platform that ensures high value of confidentiality, privacy, interoperability, integrity over immutable patient’s medical records, which improves the quality as well as reduces the cost of healthcare. The solution also implements hashing and Aadhaar authentication to fortify the secure sharing of healthcare data. The solution promises anonymized consistent accessibility to healthcare providers, partners, payers and patient to secured and updated unambiguous patient's medical records in trusted, secure & consensual way with ability of immediate  access to wide range of normalised, patient’s non-identifiable information. The platform also allows automatic gathering, replication and distribution of data from Electronic Data Capture (EDC) machines with extreme control for appreciable tracking.
